## Week 1 - History
- One writing system can be used by many languages
- We still use base-60 for time (minutes, seconds) and angles (degrees in a circle)
- Monospace fonts are still predominantly used for writing code today for readability and alignment

## Week 2 - Bits-and-Bytes
- Volatile - data is lost when power is off (RAM)
- Non-Volatile - data persists without power (SD, HDDs, SSDs)
- Unsigned Numbers: Range from 0 to 255 for 8 bits.
- Signed Numbers: Range from -128 to 127 for 8 bits.
- Fractional Numbers: Represented using scientific notation with two integers.

## Week 3 - Text-Structure
- Browsers are some of the most complex projects on the planet
- Lines are fundamental in coding
- Indentation helps in visual understanding
- Paragraphs are important in HTML for text presentation

## Week 4 - Keyboards-and-Editors
- QWERTY: Most common keyboard layout
- Word Processors (e.g., Microsoft Word): Designed for rich text formatting (fonts, colors, layout)
- Text Editors (e.g., Notepad, Notepad++, VS Code, Vim): Designed for plain text

## Week 5 -  Command Line Interfaces (CLI)
- Some functionalities are only available via CLI
- General format: command [subcommand] [options/flags] [arguments]
- Command: The main program name (e.g., ls, cat, cd)
- Subcommand: Some complex tools have subcommands (e.g., git add, git commit)
- Arguments: The inputs the command operates on (e.g., filenames, directory names)
- SSH (Secure Shell): Connect to remote computers securely, allowing command line access to remote systems
